Official source for the bot sparkbot


# Setup instructions 

[You can invite the original here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=975699960869838869&permissions=8&scope=bot)
I have commented the bot file so you don't need to constantly keep changing windows and getting confused.

# Credits
- An Idiots Guide for intent setup:
I had some trouble getting it to read messages, so I saw the first line from An Idiots Guide had the right intents (Fuck intents, you didn't need them 2020)


# Final
Any suggestions? Email them to me `sparkfire298@gmail.com`,
Please be respecful when using the bot, nothing is hidden and what you see is what there is
